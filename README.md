## Install
- Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
- Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.
- Run the game using **SMAPI**.

**This mod doesn't do anything on its own; you need to install content packs separately.**

## For players
**To use this framework, you need to install a Transport Framework content pack.** These content packs add new destinations to the base game's transport networks (Minecart, Bus, Boat, Parrot Express) or create new transport networks with their own destinations.

## For mod authors
The Transport Framework content packs allow you to add transport stations to the base game's transport networks or create your own transport networks without any programming. Refer to the [mod author documentation](https://github.com/mouahrara/TransportFramework/wiki) for more information.

## Accessibility
English and French translations are included in the base mod, and contributions are welcome. To contribute, please submit a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mouahrara/TransportFramework/pulls).

## Compatibility
Transport Framework is compatible with Stardew Valley 1.6.0+ on Linux/Mac/Windows, both single-player and multiplayer.
